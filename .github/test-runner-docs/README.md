# Test runner guide

A test runner is a small program that consumes one `.tests.json` fixture from the registry, drives a clear-signing implementation against each case, and writes a `results.json` describing what the implementation rendered. The CI workflow ([`descriptor-tests.yml`](../workflows/descriptor-tests.yml)) wraps the runner in a composite action that runs it once per affected descriptor in one job per implementation, uploads the `results.json` files as one artifact per implementation, and the results workflow ([`descriptor-test-results.yml`](../workflows/descriptor-test-results.yml)) aggregates per-implementation columns onto the PR.

## Input

The runner is invoked with a path to a `.tests.json` fixture and the descriptor it points to. The fixture conforms to [`specs/erc7730-tests-v2.schema.json`](../../specs/erc7730-tests-v2.schema.json).

The runner is responsible for:

- Resolving ERC-7730 `includes` itself — the CI does not pre-flatten descriptors.
- Honoring the fixture's optional `dataProvider` block (mock token metadata, address-name lookups, etc.) instead of hitting the network.
- Producing rendered output for every case, regardless of whether it matches `expected`.

## Output

Write a single `results.json` per descriptor to the working directory.

`rendered` mirrors the shape of `expected` in the fixture — the same `{intent, owner, fields}` form applies to both calldata and EIP-712 cases. `fields` is an ordered array of `{label, value}` entries, never an object keyed by label: labels can repeat when a field iterates over an array.

### Fields

| Field                 | Required    | Type   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runner`              | yes         | string | Identifier of the test runner harness emitting this file. Always `@ethereum-sourcify/clear-signing-test-runner`                                                                                                                                             |
| `implementation`      | yes         | string | Identifier of the clear-signing implementation under test, in `package@version` form                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `cases[].description` | yes         | string | Copied verbatim from the `description` field of the source test case — used to join back to the fixture. Fixtures must keep descriptions unique within a file; runners can rely on that to key results without collision                                    |
| `cases[].status`      | yes         | enum   | One of `pass`, `fail`, `error`, `skipped` (see below)                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `cases[].rendered`    | conditional | object | What the runner produced. Same shape as `expected` in the test data file — see [The `expected` block](../../README.md#the-expected-block) in the main README for the field-level breakdown. Required on `pass` and `fail`; omitted on `error` and `skipped` |
| `cases[].message`     | optional    | string | Human-readable note. Required on `error` and `skipped`; optional on `fail`                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `cases[].warnings`    | optional    | array  | Notes that did not change the verdict, one string each.

| `cases[].format`      | optional    | string | The `display.formats` key the implementation matched. The test report page compares it with the key that the selector of the transaction hits                                                                                                              |
| `cases[].chainId`     | optional    | number | The chain the implementation rendered for                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `cases[].durationMs`  | optional    | number | How long the case took, in milliseconds                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The optional keys are read by the test report bundle, see [`bundle.md`](./bundle.md). A runner that omits them loses nothing in the comment. A coding agent that must fix a pull request follows [`agent-instructions.md`](./agent-instructions.md).

**Calldata formatters.** Fields that use a calldata formatter (the field's value is itself an encoded inner call) appear as a nested `rendered`-shaped object in `fields`; nesting is recursive.

`runner` vs `implementation`: the runner is the harness that drives the test (one identifier across all jobs); the implementation is the codebase being exercised by that harness (varies per job). The PR comment groups results by `implementation`.

### Status values

- **`pass`** — runner produced `rendered` output and it matched the fixture's `expected` block.
- **`fail`** — runner ran cleanly but `rendered` did not match `expected`. The `post-results` job computes the diff. Optionally include a `message`.
- **`error`** — runner crashed, timed out, or could not process the input for reasons unrelated to clear-signing semantics. Always include a `message`.
- **`skipped`** — runner intentionally chose not to run this case. Always include a `message` explaining why.

### Examples

- [`pass.example.json`](./pass.example.json)
- [`fail.example.json`](./fail.example.json)
- [`error.example.json`](./error.example.json)
- [`skipped.example.json`](./skipped.example.json)

## Wiring into CI

Wrap the runner in a composite action under `.github/actions/run-<name>-tests/` that takes the test matrix of the `detect-testsv2` job, runs the runner once per entry and writes one `<entity>__<descriptor>.json` per entry into an output directory. Add a sibling job in [`descriptor-tests.yml`](../workflows/descriptor-tests.yml) that calls the action and then [`upload-test-results`](../actions/upload-test-results/action.yml), which validates the files, publishes them as one artifact and fails the job on a case that did not pass. One job per implementation, not one per descriptor, keeps the checks of a pull request short.

See [`run-sourcify-tests`](../actions/run-sourcify-tests/action.yml) for a complete reference implementation.
