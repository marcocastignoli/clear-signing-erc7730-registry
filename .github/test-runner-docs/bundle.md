# Test report bundle

A bundle is one JSON file that describes one run of the [Descriptor Tests](../workflows/descriptor-tests.yml) workflow on a pull request. The results workflow builds it with [`build-bundle.js`](../scripts/build-bundle.js) from the artifacts of the run, commits it to the `test-reports` branch as `pr/<number>/<run id>.json`, and links to the test report viewer, which reads the bundle from `raw.githubusercontent.com`.

The bundle is the contract between this repository and the viewer, which lives in its own repository. `schemaVersion` names the version of this document. The number goes up only for a change that breaks an old reader: a renamed or removed key, or a changed shape. A new optional key does not bump it. A bundle keeps its version forever, so the viewer reads every version it has known.

Every string under `descriptors` and `recommendations` comes from the pull request, that is from a fork. The bundle copies it as data. A reader must escape it and must never build a link from it unless the value matches a strict pattern.

A coding agent that must fix a pull request reads the bundle as [agent-instructions.md](./agent-instructions.md) tells it.

## Top level

| Key | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | number | `1` |
| `generatedAt` | string | ISO 8601 time of the build |
| `run.id` | number | The workflow run, from the `workflow_run` event |
| `run.url` | string | Link to the run |
| `run.startedAt`, `run.completedAt` | string or null | ISO 8601, from the event |
| `pr.number` | number | The pull request |
| `pr.url`, `pr.title` | string or null | From the event |
| `pr.headSha` | string | The commit that was tested, from the event |
| `pr.headRepo` | string | `owner/name` of the head repository, from the event |
| `pr.baseSha` | string or null | The base commit the descriptors were compared to |
| `implementations` | array | One entry per runner artifact slug, sorted by `id` |
| `implementations[].id` | string | The artifact slug, e.g. `sourcify-ts-clear-signing`. Keys the `results` map of every case |
| `implementations[].runner` | string or null | The `runner` field of the runner's `results.json` |
| `implementations[].implementation` | string or null | The `implementation` field, `package@version` |
| `missingTests` | array of string | Affected descriptors with no `testsv2` file |
| `recommendations` | array | Optional. Every suggestion for the files of the pull request, see below |
| `descriptors` | array | One entry per matrix entry, in matrix order |

### `recommendations[]`

An optional addition to schema version 1. An older bundle does not have the key; read it as an empty list.

The list comes from [`check-recommended-fields.js`](../scripts/check-recommended-fields.js), which the test run writes to `recommendations.json` in its `pr-context` artifact. The script reads each changed descriptor and shared file as it is, without its `includes`, so an item names the file that the author must edit. A suggestion never blocks the pull request.

| Key | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | `no-interpolated-intent` or `deprecated-key`. A reader ignores a type it does not know |
| `file` | string | Repository path of the file to edit, e.g. `registry/safe/common-Safe.json` |
| `pointer` | string | [RFC 6901](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901) JSON Pointer into `file`: the format for `no-interpolated-intent`, the key for `deprecated-key`. In a segment, `~1` is `/` and `~0` is `~` |
| `message` | string | One sentence that explains the suggestion |
| `format` | string | `no-interpolated-intent` only: the format key |
| `key` | string | `deprecated-key` only: `context.contract.abi` or `context.eip712.schemas` |

## `descriptors[]`

| Key | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | Repository path, e.g. `registry/flare/calldata-AssetManager-FXRP-Flare.json` |
| `entity`, `name` | string | The two parts of the path |
| `kind` | `calldata` or `eip712` | From the file name prefix |
| `change.descriptor` | string | `added`, `modified`, `deleted`, `unchanged` or `unknown`. `modified` also when the pull request changed only a file of the descriptor's `includes` chain |
| `change.viaInclude` | `true`, optional | Present when the pull request changed a file of the descriptor's `includes` chain while the descriptor file itself is unchanged. The detect job decides this from the changed files of the pull request, so the state of the base branch has no effect |
| `change.includes` | array of string, optional | The changed files of the descriptor's `includes` chain, sorted; can be empty. A bundle from an older run does not have the key |
| `change.tests` | string | Same values as `change.descriptor`, for the test file |
| `testFile` | string or null | Repository path of the test file |
| `head` | object or null | The descriptor at `pr.headSha`, with `includes` resolved |
| `base` | object or null | The descriptor at `pr.baseSha`, resolved, when it existed there |
| `dataProvider` | object or null | The `dataProvider` block of the test file |
| `formats` | object | One entry per key of `head.display.formats`, see below |
| `recommendations` | array | The suggestions that apply to this descriptor, see below |
| `cases` | array | One entry per test of the test file, in file order |

### `formats`

Keyed by the format key exactly as the descriptor writes it.

| Key | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `selector` | string or null | The 4-byte selector of a calldata format key |
| `primaryType` | string or null | The type name of an EIP-712 format key |
| `error` | string or null | Why no selector could be derived |
| `cases` | array of string | The `description` of every case that hits this format. Empty means the function has no test |

### `descriptors[].recommendations[]`

The items of the top-level `recommendations` that apply to this descriptor. An item applies when its `file` is the descriptor or a file in its `includes` chain. A `no-interpolated-intent` item applies only when `head.display.formats` has the format and the resolved format still has no `interpolatedIntent`, because a descriptor can override a format of the file that it includes.

| `type` | Other keys | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `no-interpolated-intent` | `format` | The format has no `interpolatedIntent` |
| `deprecated-key` | `key` | The descriptor uses `context.contract.abi` or `context.eip712.schemas` |

Every item also has the optional keys `file` and `pointer`, with the meaning of the top-level list. They are an optional addition to schema version 1: an older bundle does not have them.

### `cases[]`

| Key | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | string | The join key, copied from the test |
| `index` | number | Position in the test file |
| `input.type` | `calldata`, `eip712` or `unknown` | |
| `input.chainId` | number or null | From the raw transaction, or from `domain.chainId` |
| `input.to` | string or null | The target address, or `domain.verifyingContract` |
| `input.value` | string | Wei as a decimal string. Calldata only |
| `input.selector` | string or null | First 4 bytes of the calldata. Calldata only |
| `input.txType` | string or null | `legacy`, `eip1559`, … Calldata only |
| `input.primaryType` | string or null | EIP-712 only |
| `input.error` | string | Present when the input could not be decoded |
| `format` | string or null | The format key the input hits, matched by selector or primary type |
| `expected` | object | The `expected` block of the test, with `fields` as an array of `{label, value}` |
| `from` | string or null | The signer, when the test names one |
| `txHash` | string or null | For reference only |
| `results` | object | One entry per implementation id, see below |

The raw transaction and the typed data are not in the bundle. The viewer decodes the arguments from `rawTx` itself, and reads them from the test file of the head commit when it needs them.

### `cases[].results[<implementation id>]`

| Key | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `pass`, `fail`, `error` or `skipped` | An unknown status becomes `error` with a message |
| `rendered` | object or null | The runner's output, `fields` as an array |
| `message` | string or null | The runner's note |
| `warnings` | array | The runner's `warnings`, or empty |
| `format` | string or null | The format the runner says it matched, when it reports one |
| `chainId` | number or null | When the runner reports one |
| `durationMs` | number or null | When the runner reports one |
| `diff` | array or null | Differences between `expected` and `rendered`, computed here. `null` when there is no `rendered` |
| `diff[].path` | string | `intent`, `owner`, `fields[3].value`, `fields[1].value.fields[0].label`, `fields.length`, … |
| `diff[].expected`, `diff[].got` | any | The two values, `null` when one side has none |

A case that the runner did not report gets `status: "error"` and a message, so the report shows the gap.

## The `test-reports` branch

The results workflow publishes every bundle with [`publish-report.sh`](../scripts/publish-report.sh) to the orphan branch `test-reports` of this repository. The branch holds no code, and it is written only by CI. Do not edit it by hand, and do not base work on it: it can be recreated from scratch, without history, when it grows too large.

```
README.md                    what the branch is
pr/<number>/<run id>.json    the bundle of one run of the Descriptor Tests workflow
pr/<number>/index.json       the runs of one pull request, newest first
```

One commit per run adds the bundle and rewrites the index of that pull request. Two pull requests can finish at the same time, so the push retries: it fetches the new tip, applies the two files again on top of it, and pushes again. The files of a run are only added or replaced, so this is safe. There is no root index, because every run would touch it.

The files are served at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/test-reports/pr/<number>/<run id>.json`, with open CORS and a cache of about five minutes.
